		<p style="color: darkslateblue">My name is Ty Gregory West. I was born on May 23, 2004. I am a first year scholar with the SMASH Academy program. I am a rising sophomore at Tucker High School. I am the first of 1 child. When I was younger, I had a pet fish named Nemo but he died and got flushed. I have been to 8 of the 12 states that make up the southeast United States. Growing up, I would say I had life easy. The only struggles that I can think of having was not getting the shoes I wanted. Later in life I learned that my parents did right by doing that so thank you. I was a sneakerhead and I still am. Growing up, I played 3 sports. I didn't have any interest in baseball so that was the first sport that I stopped playing. Recently, I stopped playing soccer to focus more on basketball. Right now, I play AAU for A.J. Bouye Elite. A.J. Bouye is a cornerback in the NFL playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars.</p>
		
		<p style="color: darkslateblue">During the school year, I joined the band. When that was over, I stayed with the extra-curricular activities and made the basketball team. It was fun watching all the varsity gamees for free. One aspect that I think is very important to me is music. Personally, I value it a lot more than the average person, in my opinon. I'm glad that Ms. Mpezo and Dr. Garrett accepted me into this wonderful program and gave me this oppurtunity. It's great for getting an idea of what field I want to pursue and get a head start on it. Things like speaker series give you the backstory of an individual who had to go through different trials to get to where they are now. Networking nights give you an opportunity to connect with the person and meet up with them outside of SMASH hours. </p>
